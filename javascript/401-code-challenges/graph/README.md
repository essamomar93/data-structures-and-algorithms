# Graphs
- A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them. A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list. and should include the following methods:

- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O
  - AddNode: time O(1) space O(n)

  - AddEdge: time O(1) space O(n)

  - GetNodes: time O(n) space O(1)

  - GetNeighbors: time O(1) space O(1)

  - Size: time O(1) space O(1)
